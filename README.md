# two-joint-arm-kinematics
A demonstration of Inverse Kinematics for team 3161

## Why?
For FRC 2023's game our team (Tronic Titans 3161) decided to build a pivoting arm with a wrist and the end; However to get the most out of it the programming team would need to use correct kinematics to program the arm to move.

This demonstration is a simple two joint arm with **no angle limit** just to show how the arm would probably look like for competition.

## Examples

This video(click on the image below) shows how the arm moves along the X axis and the 2 graphs are the 2 possible angle solutions to the same X and Y points
